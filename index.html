              contracts. So basically they are the boss of it all.

        <p class="about-para">
          Hornclaw is our humble attempt to ‘fix’ the glaring and longstanding
          asymmetries rampant in traditional stock markets - information gaps
          and opacity, lack of expertise, and many other such realities - which
          effectively skew success in favour of the wealthy and act as entry
          barriers for the ‘masses’. Signs that a socio-fiscal revolution is
          brewing have been apparent ever since cryptocurrencies hit the common
          consciousness of the young and hungry across the globe. The record
          smashing numbers, the sheer scale of adoption, the passionate
          conversations on social media and in living rooms - all pointed to the
          fact that the world is waiting to disrupt finance as we’ve known it
          for the last few centuries. The aim that we seek to achieve with
          Hornclaw is to bring the worlds of trading and gaming together in ways
          that are easy to understand and risk-efficient. Hornclaw - for the
          people, in the language of the people, and in favour of the people.
